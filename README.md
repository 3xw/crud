# Introduction

The `Crud` plugin allow high reusability of the default Create (`add` action), Retrieve (`index` and `view` action), Update (`edit` action) and Delete (`delete` action`) (CRUD) in your controllers

Usually the basic code for controller CRUD actions is very simple, and always look the same - this plugin will add the actions to your controller so you don't have to re-implement them over and over

The plugin makes it very rapid to build out your controllers, and let you focus on your application logic.

Crud also provides build in features for JSON and XML Apis for any action you have enabled through Crud - that means no more double work maintaining both a HTML frontend and a JSON and/or XML interface for your applications - saving you tons of time.
