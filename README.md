# Introduction

The Crud plugin allow high reusability of the default Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete (CRUD) actions in our controllers

Usually the forms is very simple, and always look the same - this plugin will add the actions to your controller so you don't have to reimplement them over and over

It only works with CakePHP 2.1 - as it utilizes the new event system

The plugin requires a PSR-0 autoloader, if you don't have one, please install https://github.com/nodesagency/Platform-Common-Plugin
