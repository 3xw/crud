# Introduction

The Crud plugin allow high re-usability of the default Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete (CRUD) actions in your controllers

Usually the code for CRUD is very simple, and always look the same - this plugin will add the actions to your controller so you don't have to re-implement them over and over

It only works with CakePHP > 2.1 - as it utilizes the new event system
