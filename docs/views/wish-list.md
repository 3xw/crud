# Crud View

Inspiration

## General

* Agnostic on authentication and authorization

## Index

* Normal index lists
* "Scopes" (active, deleted etc.)
* "labels" (e.g. checkmark / minus for boolean) for fields in the list
* change order of fields
* configuration for each file (e.g. date format)
* Filters (Using CakeDC/search?)
** Date
** Search
* API links for current request
* Action items (Add new etc.)

## Form

* Basic `$this->Form->inputs()`
* Allow creation of tabbed forms / fieldsets
* Custom widgets for form fields (upload, date etc.)
* Nice selector of related records other than just selects (they suck for big lists)
